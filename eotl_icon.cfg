// This config should be placed into addons/sourcemod/configs/ directory

// The "<iconID>"'s below will map directly to the iconID each player has
// in the vip_users table.  ie: if a player has iconID "potw" in the database
// it will cause them to get the "potw" icon as defined below.  If a player has
// an iconID in the database that isn't listed below they will get no icon.
"icons"
{
	// format:
	// "<iconID>"
	// {
	//	"vmt"			"path/to/icon.vmt"
	//	"vtf"			"path/to/icon.vtf"
	//
	//  These follow 2 are optional.  They will run commands server side
	//  when an icon is created (aux_add_cmd) and when it is removed
	//  (aux_remove_cmd).  These commands will run for each user that has
	//  the icon.  There are 2 substitution variables supported:
	//
	//  {userid} which is the user's id, you will likely want to put a # in front of it. ie: #{userid}
	//  {name} which is the player name
	//
	//	"aux_create_cmd"	"sm_evilbeam #{userid}; say {name} is cool"
	//	"aux_remove_cmd"	"sm_evilbeam #{userid}"
	// }
